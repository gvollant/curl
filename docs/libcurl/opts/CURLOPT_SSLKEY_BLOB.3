.TH CURLOPT_SSLKEY_BLOB 3 "24 Jun 2020" "libcurl 7.71.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_SSLKEY_BLOB \- set private keyfile for TLS and SSL client cert from memory blob
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSLKEY_BLOB, struct curl_blob *stblob);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a blob structure, which contain information (pointer and
size) about a memory block with binary data of private key. Compatible with OpenSSL.
The format (like "PEM") must be specified with \fICURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE(3)\fP.

If the blob is initialized with curl_init_blob_dup, the application does not
have to keep the buffer around after setting this.
If the blob is initialized with curl_init_blob_persist, the application must
keep the buffer around after setting this.

option.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL
.SH PROTOCOLS
All TLS based protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  struct curl_blob stblob;
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
  stblob.data = certificateData;
  stblob.len = filesize;
  stblob.flags = CURL_BLOB_DUPFLAG_COPY;
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSLCERT_BLOB, &stblob);
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE, "PEM");
  stblob.data = privateKeyData;
  stblob.len = privateKeySize;
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSLKEY_BLOB, &stblob);  
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD, "s3cret");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE, "PEM");  
  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in libcurl 7.71.0. If built TLS enabled.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if TLS enabled, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or
CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
