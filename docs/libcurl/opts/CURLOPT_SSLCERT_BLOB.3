.TH CURLOPT_SSLCERT_BLOB 3 "24 Jun 2020" "libcurl 7.71.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_SSLCERT_BLOB \- set SSL client certificate from memory blob
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSLCERT_BLOB, struct curl_blob *stblob);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a blob structure, which contain information (pointer and
size) about a memory block with binary data of certificate. The format
must be "P12" on Secure Transport or Schannel. The format must be "P12"
or "PEM" on OpenSSL, . 
The string "P12" or "PEM" must be specified with \fICURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE(3)\fP.


If the blob is initialized with curl_init_blob_dup, the application does not
have to keep the buffer around after setting this.
If the blob is initialized with curl_init_blob_persist, the application must
keep the buffer around after setting this.

option.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL
.SH PROTOCOLS
All TLS based protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  struct curl_blob stblob;
  stblob.data = certificateData;
  stblob.len = filesize;
  stblob.flags = CURL_BLOB_DUPFLAG_COPY;
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSLCERT_BLOB, &stblob);

  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
